![alt=""](Images/application-image.png)

You can use the `PyChain` ledger and user interface by running your Streamlit application and storing some mined blocks in your `PyChain` ledger. Then test the blockchain validation process by using your `PyChain` ledger. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder where you've coded this assignment.

2. In the terminal, run the Streamlit application by using `streamlit run pychain.py`.

3. Enter values for the sender, receiver, and amount, and then click the Add Block button. Do this several times to store several blocks in the ledger.
